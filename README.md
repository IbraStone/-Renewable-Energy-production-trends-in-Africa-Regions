# Project Description:
1. Introduction
Understanding the utilization of renewable energy sources is vital in shaping the energy landscape of Africa. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the adoption and growth of renewable energy technologies in African countries, with a specific focus on the years from 2010 to 2021. The objective is to offer valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and researchers by exploring the evolution of renewable energy usage over time, uncovering regional disparities, and identifying the factors influencing the adoption of renewable energy sources. This analysis seeks to shed light on the progress, challenges, and opportunities in the transition towards sustainable and clean energy solutions in the African continent.
# Scope of the project
This project aims to analyze renewable energy trends in African countries from 2010 to 2021, offering insights for policymakers, businesses, and researchers. The analysis will assess regional disparities, the influence of various renewable energy technologies on industries, and provide data-driven guidance for policy formulation and business decisions.The project also contributes to the academic understanding of renewable energy adoption in Africa and addresses challenges and opportunities in the sustainable energy transition.
# Dataset
The dataset provides information on renewable energy production across African countries, categorized by energy source, country, and year. It comprises three main features: 'Country,' 'Energy Source,' and 'Year,' with corresponding values indicating the renewable energy production (in billion kWh) for each combination. This dataset enables analysis of the evolution of renewable energy adoption in Africa, examining trends across countries and over time, and provides insights into the distribution of renewable energy sources across the continent.

# Attribute Information
Country: The specific African country for which the renewable energy data is recorded. This feature specifies the geographical location context for renewable energy production.

Year: The year in which the renewable energy data was collected. This temporal attribute allows for time-based analysis to identify trends and changes in renewable energy production over different years.

Energy Source: The type of renewable energy source, such as solar, wind, hydroelectricity, geothermal, biomass, and others. This feature categorizes the data by the specific renewable energy technology.

Energy Production (billion kWh): The numeric attribute representing the amount of renewable energy production in billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) for the given country, year, and energy source. This attribute quantifies the level of renewable energy generation within the specified context.

# Data preparation and validation
Data collection : US Energy Information Administration
Data Cleaning and manipulation : Excel
Analysis tools : Python

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain a preliminary understanding of the dataset. Create summary statistics, data visualizations, and descriptive reports. Identify trends, patterns, and potential areas of interest.

Let's now load the dataset. As we can see above, the variables:
